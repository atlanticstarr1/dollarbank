Dollar Bank

Welcome to dollar bank; a new concept in banking.
This dapp is built using Ethereum smart contracts in Solidity, and React. Dollar bank pays interest on a daily basis to every customer who maintains a minimum of 1 USD balance. 

The USD/ETH exchange rates are fed to the contract using a Rhombus Lighthouse Oracle. The rate fed to the contract is 10 cents (USD) worth of ETH, which can then be used to determine which customers get interests, by converting balances to USD and vice-versa.
