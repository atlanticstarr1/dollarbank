Dollar Bank

Welcome to dollar bank; a new concept in banking. This dapp is built using Ethereum smart contracts in Solidity, and React. Dollar bank pays interest on a daily basis to every customer who maintains a minimum of 1 USD balance. 

The USD/ETH exchange rates are fed to the contract using a Rhombus Lighthouse Oracle. The rate fed to the contract is 10 cents (USD) worth of ETH, which can then be used to determine which customers get interests, by converting balances to USD and vice-versa.

FEATURES
  ENROLL ACCOUNTS
  MAKE DEPOSITS (MIN 1 USD TO GET INTEREST)
  WAIT 2 MINS TO SEE INTEREST PAID TO ACCOUNT :) (In production, interest will be paid every 24 hrs)
  MAKE WITHDRAWALS
  CLOSE ACCOUNT (Entire balance will be sent to back to wallet)
  
  ADMIN (Account 1)
  CHANGE MIN BALANCE
  CHANGE INTERST RATE
  START/STOP INTEREST PAYMENTS
  PAUSE/UNPAUSE CONTRACT (ONLY WITHDRAW AND CLOSE ACCOUNT WILL WORK)

Requirements
git
truffle v5.0.25
solidity v0.5.0
node v10.13.0
npm 6.9.0
ganache core/ganache-cli

Setting up the development environment
There are a few technical requirements before we start. Please install the following:

Node.js v10+ LTS and npm (comes with Node)
Git

Once we have those installed, we only need one command to install Truffle:

npm install -g truffle

To verify that Truffle is installed properly, type truffle version on a terminal. If you see an error, make sure that your npm modules are added to your path.

We also will be using Ganache, a personal blockchain for Ethereum development you can use to deploy contracts, develop applications, and run tests. You can download Ganache by navigating to http://truffleframework.com/ganache and clicking the "Download" button.

Launching our personal blockchain with Ganache
Before we move ahead, let's first launch our test blockchain with Ganache.

If using ganache gui, simply launch the application by clicking its icon.
If using ganache-cli open up a new terminal, and run the following command:
ganache-cli
This will spawn a new blockchain that listens on 127.0.0.1:8545 by default.

NOTE:
1. SAVE THE 12 WORD SEED/MNEMONIC GENERATED BY GANACHE.
2. NOTE the PORT ganache is running (8545, 7545 etc).

Once ganache is running, follow the below to setup the dapp.

Installation
1. git clone https://github.com/atlanticstarr1/dollarbank.git
2. cd dollarbank
Compile
3. truffle compile
Migrate to ganache blockchain
4. truffle migrate --reset
Test. All tests should pass.
5. truffle test
Install React front-end.
6. cd app
7. npm install
8. npm start

Navigate to localhost:3000 using Chrome to view the app.

METAMASK
If not already installed, the dapp will prompt you to download Metamask (Ethereum wallet) Chrome extension. All interactions with the dapp will happen through Metamask.

1. Once added to Chrome, open Metamask.
2. Connect to the correct network. In our case it would be localhost:<PORT>, where <PORT> is the port ganache is running (noted earlier)
2. Click on "Import using account seed phrase" at the bottom of Metamask and paste the 12 word seed/mnemonic (noted earlier).
3. Set your wallet password.
4. Click Restore.
5. Reload app in browser
  
  HAVE FUN !!! :):)
